# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Interactive World News Map is a progressive web application that provides users with an immersive way to explore global news through interactive geographic visualization. The application combines real-time and historical news data with geographic mapping, bias analysis, and user session management to create a comprehensive news exploration platform that can be easily deployed and self-hosted.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a news consumer, I want to visualize world news on an interactive map, so that I can understand the geographic context of global events.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user loads the application THEN the system SHALL display an interactive world map with news article pins
2. WHEN the user clicks on a news pin THEN the system SHALL display the article summary and details
3. WHEN the user toggles the view THEN the system SHALL switch between flat world map and 3D globe layouts
4. WHEN news articles are fetched THEN the system SHALL place pins based on the geographic location of the news event, not the news source location

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to explore historical news data by date, so that I can understand how events unfolded over time in different locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a previous date THEN the system SHALL display news articles that were published on that date
2. WHEN historical data is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve stored articles from the database
3. WHEN the date changes THEN the system SHALL update the map pins to reflect articles from the selected date
4. WHEN articles are initially fetched THEN the system SHALL store them persistently for future historical viewing

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a critical news reader, I want to see bias scores for news articles, so that I can make informed decisions about the information I consume.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an article is processed THEN the system SHALL analyze it using AI/ML algorithms to determine bias
2. WHEN displaying article information THEN the system SHALL show a numerical bias score with visual indicators
3. WHEN the bias analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL store the bias score with the article data
4. WHEN multiple articles cover the same event THEN the system SHALL allow comparison of bias scores across sources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have my own private session, so that my browsing history and preferences are not shared with other users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL require authentication
2. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL create an isolated session with personal data
3. WHEN a user interacts with the map THEN the system SHALL store their preferences and history separately
4. WHEN multiple users are active THEN the system SHALL ensure complete session isolation
5. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear their session data from memory

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the application easily, so that I can host it on my local server with minimal configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL provide a docker-compose.yaml file for easy setup
2. WHEN the docker-compose is executed THEN the system SHALL start all required services (web app, database, API services)
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL be accessible via web browser on the configured port
4. WHEN the system is running THEN the system SHALL persist data across container restarts

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive and modern interface, so that I can easily navigate and interact with the news map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
2. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL use modern UI components with clean typography and spacing
3. WHEN the user performs actions THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
4. WHEN loading data THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states and progress indicators
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want real-time news updates, so that I can stay informed about current events as they happen.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new articles are available THEN the system SHALL fetch and process them automatically
2. WHEN new articles are processed THEN the system SHALL update the map with new pins in real-time
3. WHEN the system fetches news THEN the system SHALL aggregate from multiple reliable news sources
4. WHEN articles are fetched THEN the system SHALL extract geographic location data for accurate pin placement

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to filter and search news content, so that I can focus on topics and regions of interest.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user applies geographic filters THEN the system SHALL show only articles from selected regions
2. WHEN the user searches by keyword THEN the system SHALL filter articles containing the search terms
3. WHEN the user applies date ranges THEN the system SHALL display articles within the specified timeframe
4. WHEN filters are active THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which filters are applied and allow easy removal

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure different LLM providers for bias analysis, so that I can choose between cloud APIs and local models based on my deployment needs and budget constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support OpenAI API, Grok API, and local Ollama models as bias analysis providers
2. WHEN using Ollama THEN the system SHALL connect to local Ollama instances and use specified models for bias analysis
3. WHEN using Grok API THEN the system SHALL authenticate and make requests to Grok's API endpoints
4. WHEN switching between providers THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent bias scoring methodology across all providers
5. WHEN a provider is unavailable THEN the system SHALL gracefully fallback to alternative providers or cached results
6. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of provider preferences through environment variables
