# Map Visualization Components

This directory contains the complete implementation of both 2D map and 3D globe visualizations for the Interactive World News Map application. Users can seamlessly switch between a traditional Leaflet-based 2D map and an immersive Three.js-powered 3D globe.

## Components Overview

### MapContainer
The main container component that orchestrates both 2D and 3D map functionality:
- Manages map data loading and state
- Provides view toggle between 2D map and 3D globe
- Handles pin selection and article modal display
- Provides error handling and loading states
- Integrates with the news data service
- Smooth transitions between view modes

### MapView
The core Leaflet map component that renders the interactive 2D world map:
- Uses OpenStreetMap tiles for the base layer
- Implements world bounds and zoom controls
- Handles map interactions (pan, zoom, click)
- Auto-fits bounds when pins are loaded
- Provides responsive design for different screen sizes

### GlobeView
The Three.js-powered 3D globe component:
- Interactive 3D Earth with realistic land/ocean visualization
- Smooth rotation and zoom controls
- 3D news pins positioned on globe surface
- Country boundaries and labels
- Atmospheric effects and animations
- Consistent interaction patterns with 2D map

### NewsPin
Individual news article markers on the map:
- Custom icons with bias-based color coding (green/orange/red)
- Interactive tooltips showing article preview
- Detailed popups with article information
- Click handlers for full article view
- Coordinate validation and error handling

### PinCluster
Clustering system for dense news areas:
- Groups nearby pins to improve performance
- Custom cluster icons showing article count
- Average bias score calculation for clusters
- Smooth zoom-to-bounds on cluster click
- Spiderfy animation for overlapping pins

### BiasIndicator
Visual component for displaying news bias scores:
- Color-coded indicators (green/orange/red)
- Numerical score display
- Multiple size variants
- Accessible design with proper contrast

### ArticleModal
Full article display modal:
- Complete article content and metadata
- Bias analysis visualization
- Source information and publication date
- Sharing and interaction features

- Smooth pan and zoom interactions

### ✅ 3D Globe Visualization
- Realistic Earth with procedural land/ocean coloring
- Interactive rotation with mouse drag controls
- Zoom controls with mouse wheel
- Country boundaries and major region labels
- Atmospheric glow effects

### ✅ Custom News Pin Markers
- Bias-based color coding system
- Custom SVG-like icons using DivIcon
- Hover effects and selection states
- Coordinate validation and error handling

### ✅ Pin Clustering
- Automatic clustering for dense areas
- Custom cluster icons with article counts
- Average bias score visualization
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### ✅ Map Interaction Handlers
- Click handlers for pins and clusters
- Zoom and pan event management
- View state synchronization
- Auto-fit bounds for pin collections

### ✅ Article Preview System
- Tooltip previews on pin hover
- Detailed popups with article summaries
- Click-through to full article modal
- Bias score integration

## Technical Implementation

### Dependencies
- `leaflet`: Core 2D mapping library
- `react-leaflet`: React bindings for Leaflet
- `react-leaflet-cluster`: Clustering functionality for 2D map
- `three`: 3D graphics library for globe visualization
- `@types/three`: TypeScript definitions for Three.js
- `@mui/material`: UI components and styling

### Performance Optimizations
- Pin clustering reduces DOM elements
- Coordinate validation prevents invalid renders
- Lazy loading of map tiles
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo patterns
- Viewport-based pin filtering

### Accessibility Features
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatible tooltips
- High contrast color schemes
- Focus indicators for interactive elements

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-optimized controls
- Touch-friendly pin sizes
- Adaptive clustering thresholds
- Responsive popup layouts

## Usage Example

```tsx
import { MapContainer } from './components/map';

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '100vh', width: '100vw' }}>
      <MapContainer
        autoRefresh={true}
        refreshInterval={300000} // 5 minutes
        onError={(error) => console.error('Map error:', error)}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
